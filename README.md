# AB-Testing-for-Player-Retention-in-Cookie-Cats-Mobile-Game

## 1.Project Overview
This project analyzes player retention data from an A/B test conducted in the mobile game Cookie Cats. The test evaluated the impact of placing a "gate" (a lock to encourage in-app purchases or slow down progress) at level 30 versus level 40 on player retention.

## 2.Goal
Determine whether placing the gate at level 30 improves 1-day and 7-day player retention compared to level 40, using statistical analysis and bootstrapping.

## 3.Technologies
Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy
